# Traffic Control with DL
Here I am trying to teach a computer how to effectively change signals of traffic lights on an intersection. The repo is updating..

If you are here by any chance, you may watch the process of training here: http://84.201.130.188:6006/
# The idea and results
TBD..

yet look at what the model does after 100 epochs of training:
